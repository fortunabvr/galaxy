Galaxy is a network of tiny computers running various decentralized and crypto services, cryptocurrencies and networks around the world. These tiny computers provide networks to quickly bootstrap to a galaxy of nodes.

## Install Instructions for Mac and Linux (Pi and x86 varieties)

#### Open a Terminal and run:

```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/galaxypi/galaxy/develop/install.sh)
```

Then you can do a `cd ~/galaxy` and you're ready to run the program!

The installer should prompt you to type `./galaxyd start` when it is finished.  This will
start syncing the blockchain, and your computer will become a part of the world's biggest network of nodes.

After the blockchain syncs, you can make a wallet!  In a second terminal window, you would type
`./galaxycli keys add chicken` -- but you don't need to name your key chicken, you can call it anything you want.

After entering a passphrase, you should see output approximately like:

```
NAME:	TYPE:	ADDRESS:						PUBKEY:
chicken	local	cosmosaccaddr1ppuzqz2p4hg2fafa6d3ypnr0qhduzpah3e725p	cosmosaccpub1addwnpepqdsg4e6z0ghcqdeq8a5nmj4mvvwas0az39slu7398dvjcak6wc9fqh5n7yf
**Important** write this seed phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.
