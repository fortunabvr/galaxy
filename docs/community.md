## Roadmap

Galaxy's mission is to become the world's largest network of decentralized
nodes offering services for decentralized networks. We are looking to do this
by executing the following;

- [ ] Focus on building and scaling the Galaxy blockchain and currency
- [ ] Build a large community of open source developers
- [ ] Provide high developers with access to this network of nodes by building
      and maintaining an SDK
- [ ] Provide the best experience for developers to quickly deploy apps and
      services to decentralized networks
