# Galaxy Software Roadmap

## Milestones Completed

* First Testnet: Tested currency v0.0.1
* Second Testnet: Tested currency v0.0.2
* Third Testnet: Tested currency v0.0.3
* One-line Install script for Linux
* Fourth Testnet: Used our own daemon & CLI instead of basecoin's

## Currently Underway
* Fifth Testnet: Increasing the number of validators and full nodes.  Improving the design of the network for performance at the edges.  
* Pi Image Builder

## Future Milestones (These are not in any order)
* Launch the currency
* Connect our blockchain to the Cosmos Hub
* Arbitrary (sandboxed) code execution on nodes, with node owners getting paid for compute time by developers who built that code.  Arbitrary-- no solidity or what have you needed.  Piped to the live internet via a method similar to ngrok OR piped elsewhere via the ZeroTier VPN.
* Decentralized Chat across nodes
* VPN across nodes for egress
* Airdrops to node-operators (the sybill-prevention mechanism here is the cost of operating a node)
