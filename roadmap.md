## Overview

Galaxy is looking to become the world's largest network of decentralized nodes offering services for decentralized networks.

## Goals

- [ ] To become the world's largest network of decentralized nodes offering services for decentralized networks.
- [ ] Build a large community of open source developers
- [ ] Work with the Galaxy developer community to provide developer tools offering the highest value
- [ ] Provide the best experience for developers to quickly deploy apps and services to decentralized networks

## Execution to date

#### Galaxy Core (Blockchain)
- [x] Galaxy Testnet v0.0.1-alpha-demo
- [x] Galaxy Testnet v0.0.2-alpha-demo
- [x] Galaxy Testnet v0.0.3-alpha-demo
- [x] One-line Install script (Linux)
- [x] Galaxy Testnet v0.0.4-alpha-demo (Custom Galaxy daemon & CLI)

#### Galaxy Marketplace (Web App)
- [x] Galaxy React Web App v0.0.1-alpha

## Milestones

- [ ] **Galaxy Core**: Galaxy Testnet v0.0.5-alpha-demo (Improving the design of the network for performance at the edges)
- [ ] **Galaxy Core**: Pi Image Builder
- [ ] **Growth**: Increasing the number of validators and full nodes
- [ ] **Galaxy Token**: Launch the currency
- [ ] **Galaxy Core** & **Galaxy.ooo**: VPN across nodes for egress
- [ ] **Galaxy Core**: Airdrops to node-operators
- [ ] **Galaxy Community**: Global Galaxy hackathons bootstrapped on the Raspberry Pi network

* Arbitrary (sandboxed) code execution on nodes, with node owners getting paid for compute time by developers who built that code.  Arbitrary-- no solidity or what have you needed.  Piped to the live internet via a method similar to ngrok OR piped elsewhere via the ZeroTier VPN.
