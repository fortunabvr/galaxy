## Overview

Galaxy's mission is to become the world's largest network of decentralized nodes offering services for decentralized networks.  Galaxy is comprised of a currency which can be mined across the network and developer tools like a command line interface and a software development kit are in the pipeline which will allow developers to create third party apps and extend the capabilitities of the network.

## Goals

- [ ] To become the world's largest network of decentralized nodes offering services for decentralized networks.
- [ ] Build a large community of open source developers
- [ ] Work with the Galaxy developer community to provide developer tools offering the highest value
- [ ] Provide the best experience for developers to quickly deploy apps and services to decentralized networks
